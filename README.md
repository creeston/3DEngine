## TODO:
### Vlad:
* Using command-line arguments we load models, which we can use later. We should have dropdown list of this models and '+' button in front, to place this model to screen.
* As a user, i want to click on model, and then, using buttons (edit field and etc) to rotate it, move to another place, delete.
* As a user, i want to change light direction and add extra light sources.

### Rodion:
* We should have different lightning models.
* We should have texture mapping
